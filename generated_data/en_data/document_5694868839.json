Widely known for their size and gentle demeanor, they are the largest of the big five, an iconic group of African animals that includes the lion, African leopard, Cape buffalo, and African rhino.

In this wildlife documentary, we follow a team of researchers and documentarians as they observe and document the daily activities of these magnificent creatures. From feeding and bathing to communicating and playing, we gain a unique insight into the life of the African elephant.

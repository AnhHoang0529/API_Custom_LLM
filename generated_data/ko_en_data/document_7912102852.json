In the United States, newly-elected President Joe Biden signed a series of executive orders during his first month in office. These orders focused on climate change, COVID-19 relief, and immigration reform. Meanwhile, in the European Union, Brexit negotiations reached a critical stage, with both sides expressing optimism about a potential deal. However, tensions remained high, as the EU continued to insist on maintaining its red lines. Elsewhere, protests against government policies continued in various countries, from Hong Kong to Belarus to the United States. These protests ranged from peaceful demonstrations to violent clashes with law enforcement. Overall, the political landscape remained complex and dynamic, with numerous challenges and opportunities for progress.",

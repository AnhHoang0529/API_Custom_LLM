From ancient civilizations like Rome and Athens to modern metropolises such as New York and Tokyo, the development of cities has been shaped by various social, economic, and political factors. This research paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of urban cityscapes and their evolution over the centuries. It begins with an overview of urban cityscapes throughout history, exploring the evolution of city planning and architecture through various eras. The paper delves into the role of key figures, such as Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 and Le Corbusier, in shaping the urban landscape. Furthermore, it discusses the concept of sustainable urban development and its implementation in contemporary city planning. Ultimately, this paper offers valuable insights into the past, present, and future of urban cityscapes.",
